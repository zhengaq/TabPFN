        """A TabPFN interface for classification.

        Args:
            n_estimators:
                The number of estimators in the TabPFN ensemble. We aggregate the
                 predictions of `n_estimators`-many forward passes of TabPFN. Each
                 forward pass has (slightly) different input data. Think of this as an
                 ensemble of `n_estimators`-many "prompts" of the input data.

            categorical_features_indices:
                The indices of the columns that are suggested to be treated as
                categorical. If `None`, the model will infer the categorical columns.
                If provided, we might ignore some of the suggestion to better fit the
                data seen during pre-training.

                !!! note
                    The indices are 0-based and should represent the data passed to
                    `.fit()`. If the data changes between the initializations of the
                    model and the `.fit()`, consider setting the
                    `.categorical_features_indices` attribute after the model was
                    initialized and before `.fit()`.

            softmax_temperature:
                The temperature for the softmax function. This is used to control the
                confidence of the model's predictions. Lower values make the model's
                predictions more confident. This is only applied when predicting during
                a post-processing step. Set `softmax_temperature=1.0` for no effect.

            balance_probabilities:
                Whether to balance the probabilities based on the class distribution
                in the training data. This can help to improve predictive performance
                when the classes are highly imbalanced and the metric of interest is
                insensitive to class imbalance (e.g., balanced accuracy, balanced log
                loss, roc-auc macro ovo, etc.). This is only applied when predicting
                during a post-processing step.

            average_before_softmax:
                Only used if `n_estimators > 1`. Whether to average the predictions of
                the estimators before applying the softmax function. This can help to
                improve predictive performance when there are many classes or when
                calibrating the model's confidence. This is only applied when predicting
                during a post-processing.

                - If `True`, the predictions are averaged before applying the softmax
                  function. Thus, we average the logits of TabPFN and then apply the
                  softmax.
                - If `False`, the softmax function is applied to each set of logits.
                  Then, we average the resulting probabilities of each forward pass.

            model_path:
                The path to the TabPFN model file, i.e., the pre-trained weights.

                - If `"auto"`, the model will be downloaded upon first use. This
                  defaults to your system cache directory, but can be overwritten
                  with the use of an environment variable `TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`.
                - If a path or a string of a path, the model will be loaded from
                  the user-specified location if available, otherwise it will be
                  downloaded to this location.

            device:
                The device to use for inference with TabPFN. If `"auto"`, the device
                is `"cuda"` if available, otherwise `"cpu"`.

                See PyTorch's documentation on devices for more information about
                supported devices.


            ignore_pretraining_limits:
                Whether to ignore the pre-training limits of the model. The TabPFN
                models have been pre-trained on a specific range of input data. If the
                input data is outside of this range, the model may not perform well.
                You may ignore our limits to use the model on data outside the
                pre-training range.

                - If `True`, the model will not raise an error if the input data is
                  outside the pre-training range.
                - If `False`, you can use the model outside the pre-training range, but
                  the model could perform worse.

                !!! note

                    The current pre-training limits are:

                    - 10_000 samples/rows
                    - 500 features/columns
                    - 10 classes, this is not ignorable and will raise an error
                      if the model is used with more classes.

            inference_precision:
                The precision to use for inference. This can dramatically affect the
                speed and reproducibility of the inference. Higher precision can lead to
                better reproducibility but at the cost of speed. By default, we optimize
                for speed and use torch's mixed-precision autocast. The options are:

                - If `torch.dtype`, we force precision of the model and data to be
                  the specified torch.dtype during inference. This can is particularly
                  useful for reproducibility. Here, we do not use mixed-precision.
                - If `"autocast"`, enable PyTorch's mixed-precision autocast. Ensure
                  that your device is compatible with mixed-precision.
                - If `"auto"`, we determine whether to use autocast or not depending on
                  the device type.

            fit_mode:
                Determine how the TabPFN model is "fitted". The mode determines how the
                data is preprocessed and cached for inference. This is unique to an
                in-context learning foundation model like TabPFN, as the "fitting" is
                technically the
                forward pass of the model. The options are:

                - If `"low_memory"`, the data is preprocessed on-demand during inference
                  when calling `.predict()` or `.predict_proba()`. This is the most
                  memory-efficient mode but can be slower for large datasets because
                  the data is (repeatedly) preprocessed on-the-fly.
                  Ideal with low GPU memory and/or a single call to `.fit()` and
                  `.predict()`.
                - If `"fit_preprocessors"`, the data is preprocessed and cached once
                  during the `.fit()` call. During inference, the cached preprocessing
                  (of the training data) is used instead of re-computing it.
                  Ideal with low GPU memory and multiple calls to `.predict()` with
                  the same training data.
                - If `"fit_with_cache"`, the data is preprocessed and cached once during
                  the `.fit()` call like in `fit_preprocessors`. Moreover, the
                  transformer key-value cache is also initialized, allowing for much
                  faster inference on the same data at a large cost of memory.
                  Ideal with very high GPU memory and multiple calls to `.predict()`
                  with the same training data.
                - If `"batched"`, the already pre-processed data is iterated over in
                  batches. This can only be done after the data has been preprocessed
                  with the get_preprocessed_datasets function. This is primarily used
                  only for inference with the InferenceEngineBatchedNoPreprocessing
                  class in Fine-Tuning. The fit_from_preprocessed() function sets this
                  attribute internally.


            memory_saving_mode:
                Enable GPU/CPU memory saving mode. This can help to prevent
                out-of-memory errors that result from computations that would consume
                more memory than available on the current device. We save memory by
                automatically batching certain model computations within TabPFN to
                reduce the total required memory. The options are:

                - If `bool`, enable/disable memory saving mode.
                - If `"auto"`, we will estimate the amount of memory required for the
                  forward pass and apply memory saving if it is more than the
                  available GPU/CPU memory. This is the recommended setting as it
                  allows for speed-ups and prevents memory errors depending on
                  the input data.
                - If `float` or `int`, we treat this value as the maximum amount of
                  available GPU/CPU memory (in GB). We will estimate the amount
                  of memory required for the forward pass and apply memory saving
                  if it is more than this value. Passing a float or int value for
                  this parameter is the same as setting it to True and explicitly
                  specifying the maximum free available memory.

                !!! warning
                    This does not batch the original input data. We still recommend to
                    batch this as necessary if you run into memory errors! For example,
                    if the entire input data does not fit into memory, even the memory
                    save mode will not prevent memory errors.

            random_state:
                Controls the randomness of the model. Pass an int for reproducible
                results and see the scikit-learn glossary for more information. If
                `None`, the randomness is determined by the system when calling
                `.fit()`.

                !!! warning
                    We depart from the usual scikit-learn behavior in that by default
                    we provide a fixed seed of `0`.

                !!! note
                    Even if a seed is passed, we cannot always guarantee reproducibility
                    due to PyTorch's non-deterministic operations and general numerical
                    instability. To get the most reproducible results across hardware,
                    we recommend using a higher precision as well (at the cost of a
                    much higher inference time). Likewise, for scikit-learn, consider
                    passing `USE_SKLEARN_16_DECIMAL_PRECISION=True` as kwarg.

            n_jobs:
                The number of workers for tasks that can be parallelized across CPU
                cores. Currently, this is used for preprocessing the data in parallel
                (if `n_estimators > 1`).

                - If `-1`, all available CPU cores are used.
                - If `int`, the number of CPU cores to use is determined by `n_jobs`.

            inference_config:
                For advanced users, additional advanced arguments that adjust the
                behavior of the model interface.
                See [tabpfn.constants.ModelInterfaceConfig][] for details and options.

                - If `None`, the default ModelInterfaceConfig is used.
                - If `dict`, the key-value pairs are used to update the default
                  `ModelInterfaceConfig`. Raises an error if an unknown key is passed.
                - If `ModelInterfaceConfig`, the object is used as the configuration.

            differentiable_input:
                If true, the preprocessing will be adapted to be end-to-end
                differentiable with PyTorch.
                This is useful for explainability and prompt-tuning, essential
                in the prompttuning code.
