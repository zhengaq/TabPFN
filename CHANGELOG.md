## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Increased the default value of the `n_estimators` parameter in `TabPFNClassifier` from `4` to `8`. This change aims to improve average accuracy by default, with the trade-off of increased inference time and memory usage. ([#384](https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN/pull/384))

## [2.1.0] - 2025-07-04

### Changed
- **New Default Model**: The default classifier model has been updated to a new finetuned version (`tabpfn-v2-classifier-finetuned-zk73skhh.ckpt`) to improve out-of-the-box performance.
- **Overhauled Examples**: The finetuning examples (`finetune_classifier.py`, `finetune_regressor.py`) have been completely rewritten with a clearer structure, centralized configuration, and more robust evaluation.
- Simplified `ignore_pretraining_limits` behavior by removing redundant warnings when the flag is enabled.

### Fixed
- The model now automatically switches between `fit_mode='batched'` and standard modes when calling `fit()` and `fit_from_preprocessed()`. This prevents crashes and provides a smoother finetuning experience by logging a warning instead of raising an error.
